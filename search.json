For example, some examples of values in the first column id are 22, 325, and 140.\n\nWritten Answer\n\nIn order to compare the representation of black people among the subjects of fatal police shootings to their representation in the general population, we need to know the percent of the United States population which is black. You can find this by googling ’racial demographics of the United States‘. Include a citation with the organization and url.\n\nWritten Answer\n\n\n\n\nTask2: Reading data into a dict\nRun the code chunk below. This will select some of the features from the dataset, and put it into a Python dictionary.\n\npolicing = fatal_police_shootings_data[['id', 'name', 'date', 'armed_with', 'age', 'gender', 'race', 'state']]\npolicing_dict = policing.set_index('id').to_dict(orient='index')\n\n\nWhat information from the original csv is stored in policing_dict? What information from the original csv do we use as the keys in policing_dict? What is the type of the values in policing_dict? Hint: use type(dict[key]).\n\n\nStudent Answer Hint: create a code chunk with type(dict[key]) to find the data type of the values in our dictionary\n\n\n\nTask3: Using the database\n\nFinding a particular record: Find the record of the fatal police shooting with ID number 1694. If you’ve followed current events in the past few years, there should be a familiar name here.\n\n\nStudent Answer Add policing_dict[1694] to a code chunk\n\n\nDisplaying data from a single record: Print the name and state of the individual with ID number 1694.\n\nStudent Answer\n\nDisplaying data from multiple records: The following code will display the entire dictionary using a for loop:\n\nfor person,data in policing dict.items():\nprint(policing dict[person])\nAdd an if statement to the for loop to filter out only individuals from Minnesota. This means you’ll need to check the state for each person and only print data if the state is Minnesota.\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask4: Summarizing our data\n\nCreating a new dictionary as a subset: Instead of displaying all the information, let’s create a new dictionary that only contains inviduals from Minnesota. The syntax for this is: key:values for key, values in dict.items() if condition where condition is what you’re filtering on and dict is your dictionary. Name this new dictionary MN_selection.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nCreating summarization functions: We’d like to create a function that takes in our database dictionary and returns a dictionary with counts of occurrences of each race among subjects of fatal police shootings. The keys in this dictionary should be races, and the corresponding values should be the number of subjects of that race.\n\n\nStudent Answer The starter code for this function is below:\n\n\ndef get_race_counts(database:dict)-&gt;dict:\n  race_counts = {}\n  for person, data in database.items():\n    #add logic to populate race counts\n\n\n  return race_counts\n\n\nUsing a summarization function: Print the fraction of fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should be a number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of fatal police shootings with a black subject, by the total number of fatal police shootings.\n\n\nStudent Answer Note: using get, len, and round may be helpful.\n\n\nHow does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings compare to the proportion of black people in the United States population?\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask5: Comparing Summarizations\n\nCreate a new dictionary called unarmed_selection, which is built using dictionary comprehension on the original dictionary policing_dict. This dictionary should have the same structure as policing dict, except it will only contain entries for fatal police shootings where the subject was unarmed.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nCreate a new dictionary, called unarmed race counts, which is created using the get_race_counts function on the dictionary unarmed_selection. The purpose of this dictionary will be to count the number of occurrences of each race among subjects of fatal police shootings, including only those where the subject is unarmed.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nPrint the fraction of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should be a number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject (you can get this from the dictionary unarmed race counts), by the total number of unarmed fatal police shootings.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nHow does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed compare to the proportion of black people in the United States population? How does it compare to the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings?\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask6: Trends over time\n\nCreating a list of a single feature: Let’s now take a look at creating a list with our data. Using the code below, edit it so that only dates are shown (hint: do something to data). Now, get rid of anything that isn’t the year (use some string slicing). Name this list year_col, which contains only the year for each record in our database.\n\n\nStudent Answer Edit [data for person, data in policing dict.items()]\n\n\nCreating counts from a list: Summarize the list you just created into a dictionary where each key is a single year and the value is the count of that year in our database. Note: If you do this with dictionary comprehension use the list method count and set(year col).\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nHow do the number of fatal police shootings change over time? Do you notice any patterns or trends?\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask7: More stories to be told\nSources: * U.S. Crime and Arrest Data (FBI UCR) * U.S. Demographic Data (Census Bureau) * Police Departments’ Use of Force Data (BJS) * Pew Research on Policing * Other relevant sources (Reddit, social media, etc.)\n\nList at least two sources you found informative. Include the organization, url, and brief description of the information the source contains. This source could be an additional dataset, or it could be a result of an analysis done. Our goal is to try to link the insights from the previous tasks to other insights found elsewhere.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nCome up with at least three questions/insights that could supplement the analysis you have done so far. These questions should address some aspects of the following:\n\n\nvalidation: how can the data from these sources support or challenge the findings you’ve already made about racial disparities in fatal police shootings?\nexpansion: how can additional data be used to expand upon the analysis in new areas, or further explore systemic issues related to police shootings?\ncomparisons: how do the findings from these sources compare to the conclusion you’ve drawn from other tasks? Are there any contradictions or surprising findings?\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask8: Reflection\n\nWrite a reflection (at least five sentences) on what you learned from this project. This can include your reaction to the results of the project, as well as the process of working with the data.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\nWhen your group is done, each partner must submit a link to their workbook to Moodle. Make sure the link you shared is public."

Also, think about the ethical principles of fairness and accountability.\nThe main issues we’ve covered in class are listed below: * Benefits: What positive outcomes might each stakeholder experience if the model is deployed? * Harms: What potential negative consequences might arise for each stakeholder? Could the model cause harm or lead to incorrect conclusions? * Fairness: Is the model equally fair to all stakeholders, especially those from under-represented or vulnerable groups? Does the model avoid reinforcing bias? * Accountability: Who is responsible if the model makes a mistake? What steps should be taken if the model’s predictions are inaccurate or harmful?\nIf you decide to consider different issues, make sure to update the text boxes below to account for that. For example, if you want to consider something like medical advances you might replace the issue fairness with medical advances.\n##✏ Question 13:\nStakeholder1:\nBenefits:\nHarms:\nFairness:\nAccountability:\n##✏ Question 14:\nStakeholder2:\nBenefits:\nHarms:\nFairness:\nAccountability:\n##✏ Question 15:\nStakeholder3:\nBenefits:\nHarms:\nFairness:\nAccountability:\n##✏ Question 16: Mitigating Harm\nBased on your matrix, come up with two concrete actions that can be taken to mitigate potential harms. Example action: we’d like to ensure the model is interpretable for healthcare providers so they can understand and trust its predictions. This means we’d need to choose a model that is less complex but still robust enough to give good results.\n\nFirst option:\nSecond option:"

We have a price that’s $100,000, but the vast majority have a price under $1000.\nThinking about the tool we’re building, we might want to focus on training a model that predicts well for lower/typical prices, and ignore the really expensive ones.

Note that the distribution is still skewed - we’ll handle this in a bit.\n\nnyc = nyc[nyc['price'] &lt; 500]\n\nnyc.describe(include = \"all\")\n\nNotice that the minimum price is $0, which seems like nonsense. Let’s look at the listings with a price of $0.\n\nnyc[nyc['price'] &lt;= 0]\n\nThere aren’t too many of them, so let’s just exclude those.\n\nnyc = nyc[nyc['price'] &gt; 0]\n\nnyc.describe(include = \"all\")\n\nWe’ve seen that even restricting to prices below $500, we still have a skewed distribution. Let’s see if applying a transformation can help. First, we try applying a log function.\n\nnyc[\"price\"].apply(np.log).hist(bins = 50)\n\nLet’s also see what happens with applying a square root function.\n\nnyc[\"price\"].apply(np.sqrt).hist(bins = 50)\n\nWe’ll choose to apply the log transformation. Note that applying such a transformation does make sense here, because the difference between prices $400 and $450 is less significant than the difference between prices $50 and $100.\n##💻 Q5: Log Price Add a new column called log_price, which has the log transformation appied to the column price. Then, drop price from the dataframe.\n\n# add column log_price\nnyc[\"log_price\"] = #your code here\n\n#drop price\n#your code here\n\nnyc.describe(include = \"all\")\n\n\nassert(np.isclose(nyc[\"log_price\"].mean(), 4.60618))\nassert(\"price\" not in nyc.columns)"

We’ll create a histogram to see the distribution of the data.\n\nnyc['number_of_reviews'].hist(bins = 50)\n\nThis has a very dramatic right skew, so let’s try applying some transformations. We’ll start with a log transformation.\nNow, if we were to apply the log transformation to this feature we would end up with an error. To fix this we need to add 1 to each value prior to log transforming it. This process is called smoothing and can be particularly helpful when working with text data in the future.\n##✏ Q6: Add one smoothing\nExplain why we need to add 1. Hint: are there any values that when you apply the log transformation you would run into issues?\n[your answer here]\nNow let’s visualize this add-one smoothing log transformation\n\nnyc[\"number_of_reviews\"].apply(lambda x: (np.log(x+1))).hist(bins = 50)\n\nThis is an improvement, but still right skewed. Let’s look at a square root transformation next.\n\nnyc[\"number_of_reviews\"].apply(np.sqrt).hist(bins = 50)\n\nThat’s not as good as the log transformation.\nSince the result of the log transformation is still pretty skewed, let’s try applying the log transformation again. Again, we’ll have to add 1 before applying the log transformation.\n##💻 Q7: log-log function In the cell below, define a function called log_log that does the following computation: \\[ f(x) = \\log(\\log(x+1)+1)\\].\nNote: replace the keyword pass with the computation above.\n\ndef log_log(value):\n  pass\n\n# create histogram\nnyc[\"number_of_reviews\"].apply(log_log).hist(bins = 50)\n\nThis still isn’t great, but we can see that we’re going to have trouble improving much more, since the number of reviews is going to be very discrete for small numbers (hence the tall, isolated columns on the left side). So, we’ll use the log-log transformation.\nNow construct a new column, log_log_number_of_reviews, by applying the log_log function to the column number_of_reviews.

Really, we want the best combination of parameters, so we want to explore them together.\nOne way to do this is with a grid search, where we explore a grid of possible parameter values. In the cell below, you will conduct a grid search to find the best combination of max_depth and min_samples_leaf.\n\nUsing nested for loops, use the function evaluate to test all combinations of max_depth and min_samples_leaf, where max_depth ranges from 1 through 10, and min_samples_leaf ranges from 1 through 50 (can you see how I chose these ranges from the results for the individual parameters above?).\nRemember that the function evaluate returns both the testing accuracy and training accuracy. For simplicity, we will just look for the parameters with the best testing accuracy.\nFor the parameters with the best testing accuracy, store their values in the tuple parameters (with max_depth first, followed by min_samples_leaf). Store their testing accuracy and training accuracy (as found by by evaluate), in the tuple best_metrics.\n\nThe grid search should take a couple of minutes to run.

Instructor: Kim Mandery  E-mail: mander1@stolaf.edu  Office: RMS 407\nTextbook: Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python (ISL-P). This book is free and online.\n\n\n\nIt has become increasingly common to use machine learning algorithms to analyze data, draw conclusions, and build models, without direct human instruction. These algorithms have been used in a wide variety of applications, including Netflix recommendations, predicting healthcare outcomes, criminal justice, and many more. In this course, we’ll explore several common machine learning algorithms, learning how they work, and applying them to real datasets. We will cover the strengths and limitations of machine learning algorithms. We will also explore real-world applications of machine learning, and discuss the ethical and societal consequences of the use of these algorithms.\n\n\n\nThrough the lens of machine learning, we will:  - develop and interpret applications of algorithms to domain use-cases - develop working software that satisfies coding best practices - work effectively, both individually and in teams - communicate information effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences\nCourse Schedule: The schedule for this course is available here. This document is likely to be updated throughout the semester, and will be announced in class if it is.\nActive Learning and Engagement: I expect you to take an active role in class each day, participating positively, wholeheartedly, and respectfully in class/group discussions and other activities. You may need sick/mental health days. You are responsible for learning the material on the day you missed. If you are experiencing issues causing you to miss classes often, please speak with me as this may be evident of a possible failing grade. You can also visit your class dean as they are a great resource."

    "text": "It has become increasingly common to use machine learning algorithms to analyze data, draw conclusions, and build models, without direct human instruction. These algorithms have been used in a wide variety of applications, including Netflix recommendations, predicting healthcare outcomes, criminal justice, and many more. In this course, we’ll explore several common machine learning algorithms, learning how they work, and applying them to real datasets. We will cover the strengths and limitations of machine learning algorithms. We will also explore real-world applications of machine learning, and discuss the ethical and societal consequences of the use of these algorithms."

You will submit a plan for your project using the machine learning workflow, and implement the workflow using coding best practices. Your final code workbook will be submitted to Moodle prior to your presentation day. • Peer Evaluations and Workdays. We will have several project workdays in class where you will be asked to critique group projects in small groups, as well as give constructive feedback of all projects during our two presentation days. After you present your own project, you will complete a self reflection to assess what you did well, what you could improve upon, and the most important learning you discovered along the way. • Presentation Day. You will give a five-minute presentation on your project to the class. Late Work: Late penalties for each component will be included in the instructions for that component.

(This is related to what we call the “curse of dimensionality”)\n###✏ Question5: Computational Costs\nIf we apply this function to all 60,000 images, it will be computationally expensive. How might you modify the approach to make it more efficient for large datasets? For example, we may consider only a subset of the data rather than all 60k images.\n###✏ Question6: Dealing with Ties\nWhat would happen if two centroids were equally distant from a data point?

For image data, what does this “average image” actually represent visually? Would it still look like a recognizable piece of clothing?\n###✏ Question8: Mean vs Median\nThe mean minimizes the sum of squared distances to all points. What if we used the median instead?

Based on historical data of 5K cookies regarding baked_temp, sugar_index among others, the authors of Cookie Monster collected the dataset we’d like to use. The authors started a workflow but didn’t get very far — now it’s your turn to complete a proper ML workflow! Our goal is to expand upon the outlined workflow (see ReadMe in repo) in order to answer an interesting question about this data.

    "text": "Q16: Data-Driven Insights\nUse these guiding questions to articulate your key findings:\n\nWhich features mattered the most in predicting cookie quality?\nWas there anything unexpected in your EDA or model results?\nDid your modeling reveal any relationships you didn’t initially consider?\nWhat changes to the dataset (e.g., filtering, feature engineering) helped improve your results the most?\nIf someone asked you “what makes a cookie great?”, how would you answer using evidence?\n\nWrite your three insights below. Be specific and support with evidence from your workflow.\n\n✏Insight 1\n\n\n✏Insight 2\n\n\n✏Insight 3\n##✏ Q17: Framing a Data Story Good data stories go beyond charts. They interpret the findings and engage the audience. Who would care about this finding? What action or change does this insight suggest? What visual or informative result from your data best expresses this idea?\nRead through the following resources, and identify two strategies you found useful. Think of a way you could incorportate it into this analysis.\n\nCommunicating a Data Story (link)\nCreating Compelling Stories (link)\n\n\n\n✏Strategy 1\n\n\n✏ Strategy 2\n##✏ Q18: Data story pitch\nWrite a short (4-5 sentence) data story pitch as if you were sharing your results in one of the scenarios below.\nAn example pitch is given for each scenario. Use these examples to tailor to your specific results.\n\nScenario 1: you’re presenting to the CEO of a mid-sized cookie company looking to improve product quality and customer satisfaction. &gt; “Our model shows that cookies with lower baked temps and more sugar consistently score higher in quality. These two features accounted for approximately 72% of the variance. By reducing the baking temp slightly, your company could produce more satisfying cookies without changing core ingredients”\nScenario 2: you’re presenting to a group of recipe developers who are passionate about technique and ingredient optimization. &gt; “Our analysis revealed that using oat flour combined with low moisture content resulted in higher quality cookies. This effect was most pronounced when baking below 340°F. This could inspire a new cookie line that emphasizes chewy, rich textures without added fats.”\nScenario 3: you’re demoing this project at a machine learning showcase where you’re evaluated on both your technical process and communication. &gt; “We evaluated three models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN — and found that Random Forest gave the highest accuracy at 86%. Key features included sugar_index and baked_temp, which showed strong non-linear relationships with cookie quality. Our pipeline is easily adaptable for predicting quality in other baked goods.”\n\n#Bringing it all together\nNow that you’ve crafted your own pitch, let’s see how this process might look outside of the classroom.\nIn professional settings, data work usually starts not with a dataset—but with a problem. A product manager, business analyst, or client might come to you and say something like: “We’re seeing declining ratings for our cookies—can you figure out why?” or “We want to develop a low-cost but high-quality recipe. What tradeoffs can we make?”\nFrom there, your job becomes about framing the right question, identifying the most relevant data (which might not exist yet!!), and shaping a workflow around the decision-making needs of that audience. In contrast, your classroom workflow started with a dataset and built up to a pitch — in practice, it often happens in reverse.\nIn real-world projects, you rarely get a perfectly clean dataset up front. Stakeholders might change their minds halfway through. You often need to balance accuracy with speed, interpretability, or budget. This means workflows are often messier: you may prototype a model quickly to explore feasibility before refining, or spend more time understanding what metrics truly matter to decision-makers (e.g., do they care more about accuracy, cost reduction, or customer experience?).\nApplying this type of workflow in the real world relies just as much—if not more—on your adaptability and communication skills as it does on your technical abilities. Success often depends on how well you can navigate shifting goals, collaborate with stakeholders, and translate insights into meaningful action.\n#✏ Q19: Reflection\nWhat did you like about it? What could be improved? Your answers will not affect your overall grade. This feedback will be used to improve future programming assignments.\n#Grading\nFor each of the following accomplishments, there is a breakdown of points which total to 20. The fraction of points earned out of 20 will be multiplied by 5 to get your final score (e.g. 17 points earned will be 17/20 * 5 → 4.25) * (1pt) Task1 Q1: Correctly pulls in cookies.csv * (1pt) Task1 Q2: Has data dictionary * (2pt) Task1 Q3: Expands upon data dictionary with EDA insights * (1pt) Task2 Q4: The project goal is clearly articulated and provides specific context for the workflow steps, including what is being predicted and why it matters. * (2pt) Task2 Q5-Q9: At least half of the workflow outline includes clear, relevant, and actionable steps that show an understanding of ML processes (e.g., specific methods for EDA, cleaning, or model choice). * (1pt) Task2 Q5-Q9: At least 75% of the workflow outline includes well-defined and appropriate steps that logically contribute to the overall goal and modeling approach. * (1pt) Task2 Q5-Q9: All parts of the workflow outline contain clearly stated, technically appropriate steps that are directly aligned with the project’s goal. * ( 1pt) Task2 Q7: The selected models are appropriate for the dataset and task, and the reasoning reflects a thoughtful connection between model characteristics (e.g., interpretability, ability to handle feature types, performance) and the data’s structure and/or prediction goals. * (1pt) Task3 Q10-14: At least half of the code demonstrates clear alignment with the outlined workflow, including appropriate use of methods for EDA, preprocessing, modeling, or evaluation * (1pt) Task3 Q10-14: At least 75% of the code demonstrates clear alignment with the outlined workflow, including appropriate use of methods for EDA, preprocessing, modeling, or evaluation * (1pt) Task3 Q10-14: All code is clearly written, technically sound, and thoughtfully implements each step of the workflow with appropriate use of sklearn tools and data handling. * (1pt) Task3 Q13: The pipeline is well-structured, includes necessary preprocessing/modeling steps, and is flexible enough to support model selection and tuning. * (1pt) Task3 Q15: The best-fit model is clearly interpreted, with reference to performance metrics and insights from feature importance or model behavior. * (1pt) Task4 Q16: At least two insights are clearly articulated, specific, and supported with evidence from EDA, modeling, or feature engineering steps. The response shows a good understanding of the data and connects analysis to the project question. * (1pt) Task4Q17: All three insights are clearly articulated, specific, and supported with evidence from EDA, modeling, or feature engineering steps. The response shows a good understanding of the data and connects analysis to the project question. * (1pt) Task4 Q17: Strategies for creating a compelling story are applicable * (1pt) Task4 Q18: Pitch is orignial, compelling, and reflective of the analysis * (1pt) Q19: Thoughtfully reflected on the assignment"
