It will be divided into the following components (a more detailed rubric will be available later on in the semester):  • Plan, Implementation, and Submission. You will submit a plan for your project using the machine learning workflow, and implement the workflow using coding best practices. Your final code workbook will be submitted to Moodle prior to your presentation day. • Peer Evaluations and Workdays. We will have several project workdays in class where you will be asked to critique group projects in small groups, as well as give constructive feedback of all projects during our two presentation days. After you present your own project, you will complete a self reflection to assess what you did well, what you could improve upon, and the most important learning you discovered along the way. • Presentation Day. You will give a five-minute presentation on your project to the class. Late Work: Late penalties for each component will be included in the instructions for that component.

The first attempt will be during a quiz as indicated in the course schedule. There will be two retake days for any second attempts. All final attempts for standards will take place during our final exam time. The standards are graded on an 8-point scale and binned into four categories: P - proficient (8) R - small revision needed S - not satisfactory (4) I - incomplete (0) Revisions must be handed in during class on the days indicated on the schedule. Standards with an R that hand in a fully correct solution will be bumped up to a P. Otherwise it will get bumped down to an S."

Please contact me before class time to let me know of your absence. ## Cell Phone Policy and Classroom Atmosphere You are expected to contribute to a positive classroom atmosphere, which includes arriving on time, not being disruptive, being respectful, actively involving yourself in class, and silencing and putting away cell phones. There may come a time where we use technology in class – during this time you can use a laptop, tablet, or your phone if you do not have the other options available to you. At any other times, however, I do not want to see your phone out. I’ll ask you to put them away if they show up. ## Mental and Physical Health I greatly value your experience in this class, and it is my duty to facilitate a safe, caring, and productive learning environment. I recognize that you may experience a range of emotional, physical, and/or psychological issues, both in and out of the classroom, that may distract you from your learning. If you are experiencing such issues, please do not hesitate to see me– I am here to listen. We can also discuss what further resources might be available to you. ## Academic Accommodations I am committed to supporting the learning of all students in my class. If you have already registered with Disability and Access (DAC) and have your letter of accommodations, please meet with me as soon as possible to discuss, plan, and implement your accommodations in the course. If you have or think you have a disability (learning, sensory, physical, chronic health, mental health or attentional), please contact Disability and Access staff at 507-786-3288 or by visiting https://wp.stolaf.edu/academic-support/dac. ## Multilingual Students I am committed to making course content accessible to all students. If English is not your first language and this causes you concern about the course, please speak with me. Students who would like extra support with writing or speaking in English can also contact the language specialist (berryag@stolaf.edu) in CAAS. ## Managing stress, anxiety, and other issues I greatly value your experience in this class, and it is my duty to facilitate a safe, caring, and productive learning environment. I recognize that you may experience a range of emotional, physical, and/or psychological issues, both in and out of the classroom, that may distract you from your learning. If you are experiencing such issues, please do not hesitate to come see me – I am here to listen. We can also discuss what further resources might be available to you. ## Plagiarism & Academic Integrity Plagiarism, the unacknowledged appropriation of another person’s words or ideas, is a serious academic offense. It is imperative that you hand in work that is your own, and that cites or gives credit to others whenever you draw from their work. This includes citing prompts when using genAI tools or an internet search. Please see St.Olaf’s statements on academic integrity and plagiarism at: https://wp.stolaf.edu/thebook/academic/integrity/. See also the description of St.Olaf’s honor system at: https://wp.stolaf.edu/honorcouncil/. ## Communication Expectations: • Instructor/Student Expectations: I check my email frequently, and attempt to respond to questions within 24 hours. It should not be expected that I check my email after 9 PM, on Saturdays, or regularly during breaks. • E-mail Etiquette: If you have multiple questions, fewer emails with more information per email is preferred. Please include the following when sending an email: course number with section number, a description of your question(s) within the subject line, a greeting and your instructors preferred name (mine is Kim), and a sign-off using your preferred name (this is what you want others to refer to you in class by). Add screenshots of your work for clarity. ## The St. Olaf Honor System The St. Olaf Honor System has been in place at St. Olaf College since 1911. All tests, quizzes, and examinations of any kind are taken under the St. Olaf Honor System. Each student is responsible for adhering to all principles of the Honor System regardless of the individual circumstances associated with their assessment environment."
