What information from the original csv do we use as the keys in policing_dict? What is the type of the values in policing_dict? Hint: use type(dict[key]).\n\n\n\nTask3: Using the database\n\nFinding a particular record: Find the record of the fatal police shooting with ID number 1694. If you’ve followed current events in the past few years, there should be a familiar name here.\n\n\npolicing_dict[1694]\n\n{'name': 'Philando Castile',\n 'date': '2016-07-06',\n 'armed_with': 'gun',\n 'age': 32.0,\n 'gender': 'male',\n 'race': 'B',\n 'state': 'MN'}\n\n\n\nDisplaying data from a single record: Print the name and state of the individual with ID number 1694.\nDisplaying data from multiple records: The following code will display the entire dictionary using a for loop:\n\nfor person,data in policing dict.items():\nprint(policing dict[person])\nAdd an if statement to the for loop to filter out only individuals from Minnesota. This means you’ll need to check the state for each person and only print data if the state is Minnesota.\n\n\nTask4: Summarizing our data\n\nCreating a new dictionary as a subset: Instead of displaying all the information, let’s create a new dictionary that only contains inviduals from Minnesota. The syntax for this is: key:values for key, values in dict.items() if condition where condition is what you’re filtering on and dict is your dictionary. Name this new dictionary MN_selection.\nCreating summarization functions: We’d like to create a function that takes in our database dictionary and returns a dictionary with counts of occurrences of each race among subjects of fatal police shootings. The keys in this dictionary should be races, and the corresponding values should be the number of subjects of that race.\n\nThe starter code for this function is below:\n\ndef get_race_counts(database:dict)-&gt;dict:\n  race_counts = {}\n  for person, data in database.items():\n    #add logic to populate race counts\n\n\n  return race_counts\n\n\nUsing a summarization function: Print the fraction of fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should be a number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of fatal police shootings with a black subject, by the total number of fatal police shootings.\n\nNote: using get, len, and round may be helpful.\n\nHow does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings compare to the proportion of black people in the United States population?\n\n\n\nTask5: Comparing Summarizations\n\nCreate a new dictionary called unarmed_selection, which is built using dictionary comprehension on the original dictionary policing_dict. This dictionary should have the same structure as policing dict, except it will only contain entries for fatal police shootings where the subject was unarmed.\nCreate a new dictionary, called unarmed race counts, which is created using the get_race_counts function on the dictionary unarmed_selection. The purpose of this dictionary will be to count the number of occurrences of each race among subjects of fatal police shootings, including only those where the subject is unarmed.\nPrint the fraction of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should be a number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject (you can get this from the dictionary unarmed race counts), by the total number of unarmed fatal police shootings.\nHow does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed compare to the proportion of black people in the United States population? How does it compare to the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings?\n\n\n\nTask6: Trends over time\n\nCreating a list of a single feature: Let’s now take a look at creating a list with our data. Using the code below, edit it so that only dates are shown (hint: do something to data). Now, get rid of anything that isn’t the year (use some string slicing). Name this list year_col, which contains only the year for each record in our database.\n\n\n[data for person, data in policing dict.items()]\n\n\nCreating counts from a list: Summarize the list you just created into a dictionary where each key is a single year and the value is the count of that year in our database. Note: If you do this with dictionary comprehension use the list method count and set(year col).\nHow do the number of fatal police shootings change over time? Do you notice any patterns or trends?\n\n\n\nTask7: More stories to be told\nSources: * U.S. Crime and Arrest Data (FBI UCR) * U.S. Demographic Data (Census Bureau) * Police Departments’ Use of Force Data (BJS) * Pew Research on Policing * Other relevant sources (Reddit, social media, etc.)\n\nList at least two sources you found informative. Include the organization, url, and brief description of the information the source contains. This source could be an additional dataset, or it could be a result of an analysis done. Our goal is to try to link the insights from the previous tasks to other insights found elsewhere.\nCome up with at least three questions/insights that could supplement the analysis you have done so far. These questions should address some aspects of the following:\n\n\nvalidation: how can the data from these sources support or challenge the findings you’ve already made about racial disparities in fatal police shootings?\nexpansion: how can additional data be used to expand upon the analysis in new areas, or further explore systemic issues related to police shootings? *comparisons: how do the findings from these sources compare to the conclusion you’ve drawn from other tasks? Are there any contradictions or surprising findings?\n\n\n\nTask8: Reflection\n\nWrite a reflection (at least five sentences) on what you learned from this project. This can include your reaction to the results of the project, as well as the process of working with the data."

    "text": "Illness and Community Standards\nOut of respect for our learning community, if you are experiencing any symptoms of an illness, do not come to class or my office. Please contact me before class time to let me know of your absence. ## Cell Phone Policy and Classroom Atmosphere You are expected to contribute to a positive classroom atmosphere, which includes arriving on time, not being disruptive, being respectful, actively involving yourself in class, and silencing and putting away cell phones. There may come a time where we use technology in class – during this time you can use a laptop, tablet, or your phone if you do not have the other options available to you. At any other times, however, I do not want to see your phone out. I’ll ask you to put them away if they show up. ## Mental and Physical Health I greatly value your experience in this class, and it is my duty to facilitate a safe, caring, and productive learning environment. I recognize that you may experience a range of emotional, physical, and/or psychological issues, both in and out of the classroom, that may distract you from your learning. If you are experiencing such issues, please do not hesitate to see me– I am here to listen. We can also discuss what further resources might be available to you. ## Academic Accommodations I am committed to supporting the learning of all students in my class. If you have already registered with Disability and Access (DAC) and have your letter of accommodations, please meet with me as soon as possible to discuss, plan, and implement your accommodations in the course. If you have or think you have a disability (learning, sensory, physical, chronic health, mental health or attentional), please contact Disability and Access staff at 507-786-3288 or by visiting https://wp.stolaf.edu/academic-support/dac. ## Multilingual Students I am committed to making course content accessible to all students. If English is not your first language and this causes you concern about the course, please speak with me. Students who would like extra support with writing or speaking in English can also contact the language specialist (berryag@stolaf.edu) in CAAS. ## Managing stress, anxiety, and other issues I greatly value your experience in this class, and it is my duty to facilitate a safe, caring, and productive learning environment. I recognize that you may experience a range of emotional, physical, and/or psychological issues, both in and out of the classroom, that may distract you from your learning. If you are experiencing such issues, please do not hesitate to come see me – I am here to listen. We can also discuss what further resources might be available to you. ## Plagiarism & Academic Integrity Plagiarism, the unacknowledged appropriation of another person’s words or ideas, is a serious academic offense. It is imperative that you hand in work that is your own, and that cites or gives credit to others whenever you draw from their work. This includes citing prompts when using genAI tools or an internet search. Please see St.Olaf’s statements on academic integrity and plagiarism at: https://wp.stolaf.edu/thebook/academic/integrity/. See also the description of St.Olaf’s honor system at: https://wp.stolaf.edu/honorcouncil/. ## Communication Expectations: • Instructor/Student Expectations: I check my email frequently, and attempt to respond to questions within 24 hours. It should not be expected that I check my email after 9 PM, on Saturdays, or regularly during breaks. • E-mail Etiquette: If you have multiple questions, fewer emails with more information per email is preferred. Please include the following when sending an email: course number with section number, a description of your question(s) within the subject line, a greeting and your instructors preferred name (mine is Kim), and a sign-off using your preferred name (this is what you want others to refer to you in class by). Add screenshots of your work for clarity. ## The St. Olaf Honor System The St. Olaf Honor System has been in place at St. Olaf College since 1911. All tests, quizzes, and examinations of any kind are taken under the St. Olaf Honor System. Each student is responsible for adhering to all principles of the Honor System regardless of the individual circumstances associated with their assessment environment."
