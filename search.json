For example, some examples of values in the first column id are 22, 325, and 140.\n\nWritten Answer\n\nIn order to compare the representation of black people among the subjects of fatal police shootings to their representation in the general population, we need to know the percent of the United States population which is black. You can find this by googling ’racial demographics of the United States‘. Include a citation with the organization and url.\n\nWritten Answer\n\n\n\n\nTask2: Reading data into a dict\nRun the code chunk below. This will select some of the features from the dataset, and put it into a Python dictionary.\n\npolicing = fatal_police_shootings_data[['id', 'name', 'date', 'armed_with', 'age', 'gender', 'race', 'state']]\npolicing_dict = policing.set_index('id').to_dict(orient='index')\n\n\nWhat information from the original csv is stored in policing_dict? What information from the original csv do we use as the keys in policing_dict? What is the type of the values in policing_dict? Hint: use type(dict[key]).\n\n\nStudent Answer Hint: create a code chunk with type(dict[key]) to find the data type of the values in our dictionary\n\n\n\nTask3: Using the database\n\nFinding a particular record: Find the record of the fatal police shooting with ID number 1694. If you’ve followed current events in the past few years, there should be a familiar name here.\n\n\nStudent Answer Add policing_dict[1694] to a code chunk\n\n\nDisplaying data from a single record: Print the name and state of the individual with ID number 1694.\n\nStudent Answer\n\nDisplaying data from multiple records: The following code will display the entire dictionary using a for loop:\n\nfor person,data in policing dict.items():\nprint(policing dict[person])\nAdd an if statement to the for loop to filter out only individuals from Minnesota. This means you’ll need to check the state for each person and only print data if the state is Minnesota.\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask4: Summarizing our data\n\nCreating a new dictionary as a subset: Instead of displaying all the information, let’s create a new dictionary that only contains inviduals from Minnesota. The syntax for this is: key:values for key, values in dict.items() if condition where condition is what you’re filtering on and dict is your dictionary. Name this new dictionary MN_selection.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nCreating summarization functions: We’d like to create a function that takes in our database dictionary and returns a dictionary with counts of occurrences of each race among subjects of fatal police shootings. The keys in this dictionary should be races, and the corresponding values should be the number of subjects of that race.\n\n\nStudent Answer The starter code for this function is below:\n\n\ndef get_race_counts(database:dict)-&gt;dict:\n  race_counts = {}\n  for person, data in database.items():\n    #add logic to populate race counts\n\n\n  return race_counts\n\n\nUsing a summarization function: Print the fraction of fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should be a number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of fatal police shootings with a black subject, by the total number of fatal police shootings.\n\n\nStudent Answer Note: using get, len, and round may be helpful.\n\n\nHow does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings compare to the proportion of black people in the United States population?\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask5: Comparing Summarizations\n\nCreate a new dictionary called unarmed_selection, which is built using dictionary comprehension on the original dictionary policing_dict. This dictionary should have the same structure as policing dict, except it will only contain entries for fatal police shootings where the subject was unarmed.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nCreate a new dictionary, called unarmed race counts, which is created using the get_race_counts function on the dictionary unarmed_selection. The purpose of this dictionary will be to count the number of occurrences of each race among subjects of fatal police shootings, including only those where the subject is unarmed.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nPrint the fraction of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject. This should be a number between 0 and 1, and can be computed by dividing the number of unarmed fatal police shootings with a black subject (you can get this from the dictionary unarmed race counts), by the total number of unarmed fatal police shootings.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nHow does the proportion of black subjects in fatal police shootings where the subject is unarmed compare to the proportion of black people in the United States population? How does it compare to the proportion of black subjects in all police shootings?\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask6: Trends over time\n\nCreating a list of a single feature: Let’s now take a look at creating a list with our data. Using the code below, edit it so that only dates are shown (hint: do something to data). Now, get rid of anything that isn’t the year (use some string slicing). Name this list year_col, which contains only the year for each record in our database.\n\n\nStudent Answer Edit [data for person, data in policing dict.items()]\n\n\nCreating counts from a list: Summarize the list you just created into a dictionary where each key is a single year and the value is the count of that year in our database. Note: If you do this with dictionary comprehension use the list method count and set(year col).\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nHow do the number of fatal police shootings change over time? Do you notice any patterns or trends?\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask7: More stories to be told\nSources: * U.S. Crime and Arrest Data (FBI UCR) * U.S. Demographic Data (Census Bureau) * Police Departments’ Use of Force Data (BJS) * Pew Research on Policing * Other relevant sources (Reddit, social media, etc.)\n\nList at least two sources you found informative. Include the organization, url, and brief description of the information the source contains. This source could be an additional dataset, or it could be a result of an analysis done. Our goal is to try to link the insights from the previous tasks to other insights found elsewhere.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\nCome up with at least three questions/insights that could supplement the analysis you have done so far. These questions should address some aspects of the following:\n\n\nvalidation: how can the data from these sources support or challenge the findings you’ve already made about racial disparities in fatal police shootings?\nexpansion: how can additional data be used to expand upon the analysis in new areas, or further explore systemic issues related to police shootings?\ncomparisons: how do the findings from these sources compare to the conclusion you’ve drawn from other tasks? Are there any contradictions or surprising findings?\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\n\n\nTask8: Reflection\n\nWrite a reflection (at least five sentences) on what you learned from this project. This can include your reaction to the results of the project, as well as the process of working with the data.\n\n\nStudent Answer\n\nWhen your group is done, each partner must submit a link to their workbook to Moodle. Make sure the link you shared is public."

We have a price that’s $100,000, but the vast majority have a price under $1000.\nThinking about the tool we’re building, we might want to focus on training a model that predicts well for lower/typical prices, and ignore the really expensive ones. Let’s look at what happens with a few different choices for restricting the prices.\nFirst, we look at prices below $2,000.\n\nprint(\"Number of entries: \", len(nyc[nyc['price'] &lt; 2000]))\n\nnyc[nyc['price'] &lt; 2000]['price'].hist(bins = 100)\n\nNext, let’s look at prices below $1,000.\n\nprint(\"Number of entries: \", len(nyc[nyc['price'] &lt; 1000]))\n\nnyc[nyc['price'] &lt; 1000]['price'].hist(bins = 100)\n\nHere, we look at prices below $500.\n\nprint(\"Number of entries: \", len(nyc[nyc['price'] &lt; 500]))\n\nnyc[nyc['price'] &lt; 500]['price'].hist(bins = 100)\n\nLet’s focus on prices below $500. This still captures a lot of the data, while limiting us to trying to predict prices for more typical listings. Note that the distribution is still skewed - we’ll handle this in a bit.\n\nnyc = nyc[nyc['price'] &lt; 500]\n\nnyc.describe(include = \"all\")\n\nNotice that the minimum price is $0, which seems like nonsense. Let’s look at the listings with a price of $0.\n\nnyc[nyc['price'] &lt;= 0]\n\nThere aren’t too many of them, so let’s just exclude those.\n\nnyc = nyc[nyc['price'] &gt; 0]\n\nnyc.describe(include = \"all\")\n\nWe’ve seen that even restricting to prices below $500, we still have a skewed distribution. Let’s see if applying a transformation can help. First, we try applying a log function.\n\nnyc[\"price\"].apply(np.log).hist(bins = 50)\n\nLet’s also see what happens with applying a square root function.\n\nnyc[\"price\"].apply(np.sqrt).hist(bins = 50)\n\nWe’ll choose to apply the log transformation. Note that applying such a transformation does make sense here, because the difference between prices $400 and $450 is less significant than the difference between prices $50 and $100.\n##💻 Q5: Log Price Add a new column called log_price, which has the log transformation appied to the column price. Then, drop price from the dataframe.\n\n# add column log_price\nnyc[\"log_price\"] = #your code here\n\n#drop price\n#your code here\n\nnyc.describe(include = \"all\")\n\n\nassert(np.isclose(nyc[\"log_price\"].mean(), 4.60618))\nassert(\"price\" not in nyc.columns)"

We’ll create a histogram to see the distribution of the data.\n\nnyc['number_of_reviews'].hist(bins = 50)\n\nThis has a very dramatic right skew, so let’s try applying some transformations. We’ll start with a log transformation.\nNow, if we were to apply the log transformation to this feature we would end up with an error. To fix this we need to add 1 to each value prior to log transforming it. This process is called smoothing and can be particularly helpful when working with text data in the future.\n##✏ Q6: Add one smoothing\nExplain why we need to add 1. Hint: are there any values that when you apply the log transformation you would run into issues?\n[your answer here]\nNow let’s visualize this add-one smoothing log transformation\n\nnyc[\"number_of_reviews\"].apply(lambda x: (np.log(x+1))).hist(bins = 50)\n\nThis is an improvement, but still right skewed. Let’s look at a square root transformation next.\n\nnyc[\"number_of_reviews\"].apply(np.sqrt).hist(bins = 50)\n\nThat’s not as good as the log transformation.\nSince the result of the log transformation is still pretty skewed, let’s try applying the log transformation again. Again, we’ll have to add 1 before applying the log transformation.\n##💻 Q7: log-log function In the cell below, define a function called log_log that does the following computation: \\[ f(x) = \\log(\\log(x+1)+1)\\].\nNote: replace the keyword pass with the computation above.\n\ndef log_log(value):\n  pass\n\n# create histogram\nnyc[\"number_of_reviews\"].apply(log_log).hist(bins = 50)\n\nThis still isn’t great, but we can see that we’re going to have trouble improving much more, since the number of reviews is going to be very discrete for small numbers (hence the tall, isolated columns on the left side). So, we’ll use the log-log transformation.\nNow construct a new column, log_log_number_of_reviews, by applying the log_log function to the column number_of_reviews. Drop the old column, number_of_reviews, from the data frame\n\n# your code here\n\n\nnyc.describe(include = \"all\")\n\n\nassert(\"log_log_number_of_reviews\" in nyc.columns)\nassert(\"number_of_reviews\" not in nyc.columns)\nassert(np.isclose(nyc[\"log_log_number_of_reviews\"].mean(), 0.896842))"
